    title: "LXP Search - Filter Interface Design",
    description: "A comprehensive filtering interface was designed for the Learning Experience Platform's search functionality. The design prioritizes immediate access to all filtering options through an expanded view, while maintaining clean visual hierarchy and user control through collapsible sections. The interface combines multiple input types (checkboxes, tags) to provide flexible filtering options while keeping the interaction model simple and intuitive.",

    challenge: "Customers are currently having difficulties finding the content they need due to the return of irrelevant search results and a clunky user interface with limited filtering options. This makes it difficult for learners to refine their searches and locate relevant content efficiently.pr",
    process: "The design process began with crafting an expanded view interface that displays all options by default, ensuring clarity and ease of use. A strong visual hierarchy was established through strategic spacing and typography, enhancing readability and usability. Clear empty states were defined for filter sections to provide guidance when no options were selected.",
    solution: "We delivered low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, interactive prototypes, and detailed design specifications to streamline the design process. The solution focused on creating an intuitive, filterable Key Metrics feature for the Content Details tab, providing administrators with improved workflows and accessible interfaces. <br/> <br/> To support functionality, key UI elements were implemented, including a filter header with a counter and clear functionality, collapsible section headers, and checkbox inputs for binary selections. An interactive tag system was introduced for multi-select options, accompanied by empty state messaging. Consistent spacing and alignment systems were applied to maintain a cohesive and structured interface. ",
    results: "The design enhanced admin workflows for content performance analysis, improved data visualization, and enabled intuitive filtering for segmented data views. The interface adhered to WCAG guidelines, received positive stakeholder feedback, and ensured a smooth handoff to the development team, driving successful implementation.",

    challenge: "The LCMS empowers customers to manage their content while also providing valuable insights into how that content is being utilized. Itâ€™s essential to surface and display this information in a way that allows admin users to easily access and understand content performance across various user segments. <br/> <br/> The proposed feature includes a filtering mechanism that enables admins to view metrics at a high level or drill down into specific Accounts or Licenses. This functionality allows for a quick and efficient assessment of content effectiveness across different segments. By integrating this feature into the Content Details, the process of evaluating content performance is streamlined, facilitating data-driven decisions to enhance content quality and improve learner engagement strategies.  <br/> <br/> For developer handover, detailed component specifications were provided, outlining interaction states and animations. Accessibility requirements were documented to ensure an inclusive user experience, while responsive behavior guidelines were established for adaptability across different screen sizes. Additionally, typography and spacing systems were specified to maintain visual consistency throughout the design.",

    challenge: "Users of the Vision website reported issues with article legibility, including narrow fonts, hard-to-read text, and poor italic rendering in Chrome. These challenges stemmed from Microsoft's recent typographical updates to SharePoint, which negatively impacted readability and user experience.",
    process: "We conducted A/B testing with ten users from various roles at Pramerica, combining observations of body and eye movements with verbal feedback. The testing compared two prototypes: Prototype A, featuring smaller fonts to reduce scrolling, and Prototype B, designed with larger fonts to minimize eye strain.",
    solution: "An interesting observation was the difference between users' verbal feedback and their body language regarding Microsoft's implementation versus our suggested design. Users who frequently used social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook often preferred Option A but showed discomfort in reading from a comfortable position. Social media encourages continuous scrolling with tightly spaced text, which keeps users engaged but may compromise legibility.<br/> <br/> When switching from Option A to Option B, many users relaxed their posture and appeared more comfortable. Conversely, returning to Option A caused them to lean forward and hunch over. These findings suggest that regular exposure to social media has increased tolerance for less legible typography, affecting reading comfort.",
    results: "Most users found the typography in Prototype A tolerable, with some expressing a preference for it due to the smaller font that required less scrolling. However, it may be beneficial to allow users to control the font size of articles, similar to the functionality offered by Medium.com.<br/> <br/> In contrast, Prototype B typically resulted in less eye strain, with users adopting more comfortable reading positions. While engaging with Option B, users generally kept their hands resting on the table or mouse, whereas with Option A, they often held their temple or chin, indicating a more strained posture.",
